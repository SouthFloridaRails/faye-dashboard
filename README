This a browser-based dashboard for interacting with a Faye server.  The goal is to make Faye-based applications easy to debug.

FEATURES:
  1) Subscribe to channels with the push of a button.  Unsubscribe them as needed.
  2) Publish to channels by entering data in a textarea and pushing a button.
  3) All incoming/outgoing messages will be shown in the log.

INSTRUCTIONS:

  1) Download the repository for this project (git clone).
  2) Install Faye (and any dependencies).
  3) Modify dashboard.htm and dashboard.js so that they point to your Faye server.  (Look for "localhost" and "9292".)
  4) Start your Faye server.  If you don't have your own Faye server, then you can use server.js in this codebase.  Install node.js, then run "node server.js".  You may want to modify the port.
  5) Open dashboard.htm in the browser.  To avoid strange AJAX-related issues in some versions of Firefox, I recommend serving them from your web server of choice.
  6) The GUI should be mostly self-evident.  You can subscribe to channels and publish messages.  You'll then see activity in the log.

KNOWN ISSUES:
  1. Do not subscribe to "/**" or the "/meta/connect" channel.  This is more of an issue with Faye itself than the tool, and I believe there are plans to fix it soon in Faye.
