This a browser-based dashboard for interacting with a Faye server.  The goal is to make Faye-based applications easy to debug.  As a side benefit, the application can be a nice template for the client piece of your first Faye application.

Here is how to use it:

  1) git clone the repository for this project
  2) install the Faye server (and any dependencies).
  3) Modify dashboard.htm and dashboard.js so that they point to your server.  (Look for "localhost" and "9292".)
  4) If you don't have your own server, then you can use server.js in this codebase.  Install node.js, then run "node server.js".  You may want to modify the port.
  5) Open dashboard.htm in the browser.
  6) The GUI should be mostly self-evident.  You can subscribe to channels and publish messages.  You'll then see activity in the log.

KNOWN ISSUES:
  1. Firefox 3.6 does not work for some reason.  It can publish, but not get incoming messages.  The program works fine on Chrome and Safari.  It also works on FF 4.
  2. Do not subscribe to "/**" or the "/meta" channel.
